Aerios

Aerios is an aviation database and coding framework designed for easy deployment of machine learning, probabilistic programming, and optimization under uncertainty methods for commerical aviation. The current aviation data market has numerous vendors of aircraft data (Openflights, Airfleets, FlightAware, Flightradar24, Flightstats, Planefinder), in addition to numerous companies that offer bespoke data-science based algorithms and software products. The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between these two communities. More specifically, our motivation is to not treat the underlying challenges as strictly `data science` ones, but rather to view them through a holistic lens that combines computational statistics, numerical linear algebra, and aerospace engineering.
